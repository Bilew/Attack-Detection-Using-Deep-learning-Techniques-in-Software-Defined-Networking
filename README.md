# Attack Detection Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project aims to detect cyber attacks using deep learning techniques. By leveraging advanced machine learning models, the system can identify potential threats in network traffic and security logs, providing real-time or near real-time protection.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Models**: Uses CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, or transformer-based architectures for attack detection.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Provides near-instantaneous detection of threats.
- **Dataset Handling**: Supports multiple cybersecurity datasets, such as CIC-IDS2017, NSL-KDD, and UNSW-NB15.
- **Scalability**: Can be integrated into security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
- **Visualization & Reporting**: Offers logs and visual dashboards for analysis.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>=3.5)
- TensorFlow 
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for experiments)

### Setup
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bilew/Attack-Detection-Using-Deep-learning.git
cd Attack-Detection Using Deep-learning in Software-Defined Networking 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Prepare Dataset**
   - Download and preprocess the dataset.
   - the data is Split into training and testing sets.

2. **Train Model**
   python train.py --dataset dataset_name --model model_type
3. **Evaluate Model**
    - check the model evaluation 
## Dataset Sources
- [NSL-KDD](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html)
## Model Architectures
- LSTMs**: Effective for sequential data analysis.

## Prepare a network Diagram using:  
  - Mininet
  - Ryu Controller
    
## From the Ryu Contrller in the control Layer: 
   - On top of your topology diagram, test the performance of deep learning for detecting attacks/malware.
   - Then, evaluate the performance.
## Results & Performance
- Accuracy: **XX%**
- Precision: **XX%**
- Recall: **XX%**
- F1-Score: **XX%**
