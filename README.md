# Attack-Detection Using Deep-learning 
Overview

This project aims to detect cyber attacks using deep learning techniques. By leveraging advanced machine learning models, the system can identify potential threats in network traffic and security logs, providing real-time or near real-time protection.
Features

Deep Learning Models: Uses CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, or transformer-based architectures for attack detection.

Real-Time Detection: Provides near-instantaneous detection of threats.

Dataset Handling: Supports multiple cybersecurity datasets, such as CIC-IDS2017, NSL-KDD, and UNSW-NB15.

Scalability: Can be integrated into security information and event management (SIEM) systems.

Visualization & Reporting: Offers logs and visual dashboards for analysis.
